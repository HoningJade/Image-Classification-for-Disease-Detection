# DeepMed: Medical Image Analysis via Deep Learning Techniques 

I completed this PRP research project advised by Professor Bin Sheng at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I am happy to have worked with another two students Changyan Chen and Ruhan Liu on it. Our pruposed approach is of great significance to the healthcare field.

I used TensorFlow to build up and train a deep learning model, FTR-Net, that can classify patients' fundus photos accurately and efficiently to detect systemic lupus erythematosus. Based on deep learning models, this project innovatively utilizes transfer learning, feature pyramid networks, data argumentation and other techniques to overcome difficulties in classifying fundus images and greatly improve the performance of our model. Our model outperforms any existing DL-CV model on the task dataset.
